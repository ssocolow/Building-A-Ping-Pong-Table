A lot has happened including the coronavirus and close of schools, but this project has had the tangible forward momentum
that I had hoped for.  Home depot is considered an essential business, so it is still open along with supermarkets, so 
we went to home depot and bought a lot of wood an supplies.  We made 2 trips, and bought around 200 dollars worth of supplies.
The ping pong table is now going to built as 4 pieces for the table top, each piece is 2.5 feet by 4.5 feet particle board.
We are going to make 2 sawhorses with 4 feet long flat tops which will hold up three 8 foot long 2 by 4s which will then hold up 
the table top.  The table top will be drilled to the underneath 2 by 4s then we will put wood putty where the nails went in to make 
a flat surface.  We will paint the table top with 3 coats of paint before hand, and after we will put a side wood tape to protect 
the edges on.  We have all the materials, and now it is time to start building!
