It has been a while since the last entry but what basically happened is with the sawhorses and the rectangles and the 8 foot long 2 by 4s,
we totally assembled the table from the sawhorses then 8 foot long 2 by 4s then put the 4 playing surface rectangles on top.

Then we put a net up that we bought from ebay, and we have played many games and is totally functional and fun.

What we are working on now is trying to get a better net solution because the current net was finicky and also rotate the table slightly
to get more room for the players because sometimes the ball can be hit to a spot where it goes toward the walls of the basement that block
player movement.

We haven't put any wood putty or drilled any of the boards because it works fine without those things.
