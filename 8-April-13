Yesterday was Easter, and we made the I beams for the sawhorses and put them in the basement.  We bought a net
which arrived yesterday and we have balls and paddles.  So now we have to finish building the sawhorses in the basement, 
then put the three 8 ft long 2 by 4s on the sawhorses and then put the pieces of the table on top, then drill everything together, 
then cover up with wood putty and sand and maybe do a touch up painting.
