A lot happened today.
Quinn's dad, Greg, came over and we talked a lot about the table because he has built one before and can help me in this project.
I think that I will go with a different design becuse it would require us buying 2 instead of 4 sheets of plywood.
The plywood comes in 4 by 8 feet pieces, so this design would have three pieces for the large rectangle.
Two of the pieces would be 5 by 4 feet and one piece in the middle would be 5 by 1 feet.
Holding them together would be 3 of 2 by 4 feet pieces going through the intersecting spots underneath.
Two of them would be 6 inches from the outside so I have room to put my net clamps down and one would be in the middle.
Holding this entire structure up would be 4 sawhorses at the ends of the table (I think).

The sheets of plywood would be attached to the underneath 2 by 4s by tiny screws.  I think that is called countersinking.
I could coat the top rectangle in some sort of finish and sand it so that there aren't bumps in the surface.
For a line I could put a piece of painter's tape down the middle and the sides of the table and blowdry it to make it adhere more.

My next steps are to find a piece of cardboard that is 5 feet by 4 feet and see if it can fit into the basement and
to make the new design in tinkercad (a 3D design website).
